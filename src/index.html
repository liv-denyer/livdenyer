    I am a product leader in the Fintech space who has worked with a variety of customers - whether it's helping ops teams get more efficient, small businesses shake off the burden of payment terms, or consumers get real-time cashback when they spend. I love working on early-stage products where the problems are big, the data is murky, and the opportunities to have an impact are massive. I care deeply about the teams I work with and the people I manage and make it part of my job to ensure my teams are happy and healthy.

              In my time at Flux, we built and launched Flux Offers, a product that allows consumers to get instant cashback when they shop with their Flux-linked card. This enabled Flux retailers to run cashback offers on specific items or combinations of items, with real-time performance tracking and payouts. We built & launched the MVP inside of three months, and then grew our user base from 0 to 65k users, opened up a stable revenue stream & onboarded record numbers of retailers to the Flux network as a result.

            built a Xero integration and a PIS payment solution. I led the process of generating ideas, 
            testing their value using defined quant and qual metrics, and then brought this to a realistic 
            set of minimal requirements for engineers to implement. I was hands on in the day to day, 
            defining and running the processes that keep our team motivated + delivering high quality work.
